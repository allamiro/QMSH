## Quality and Auditing Management System for Hopsitals

### Introduction
The need for quality health care is very important  for hopsitals and health care organizations  to monitor assess comply and improve the standards of quality healthcare.
Quality improvement is directly related to the service delivery approach, level of patient satisfaction, efficiency and outcome.


## App Design Plan 

1. Core Components
- User Management and Authentication:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different levels of users (e.g., administrators, auditors, healthcare providers).
- Multi-factor authentication and audit trails to ensure data security.

2. Compliance Tracking:
Track compliance against different  standards, divided into key sections:

### Saudi Arabia - CBAHI 
* Compliance :
- Leadership (LD)
- Human Resources (HR)
- Medical Staff (MS)
- Quality Management & Patient Safety (QM)
- Provision of Care (PC)
- Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)
- Medication Management (MM)
- Facility Management and Safety (FMS)
- Each section can include automated checklists, evaluation forms, and real-time tracking for compliance against Essential Safety Requirements (ESRs).
  
* Audit Module:
- Automated Audits: Scheduled audits based on CBAHIâ€™s standards with specific checks for each area (e.g., medication management, patient safety).
- Manual Audits: Allow auditors to input data from physical inspections and interviews.
- Audit Logs: Maintain a log of completed audits, showing the compliance status, any deficiencies, and corrective actions. 

* Corrective Action Management (CAP):
- A system to log non-compliance issues and implement a Corrective Action Plan (CAP).
- Link the CAP to specific CBAHI requirements, and track progress on resolving the issue.
